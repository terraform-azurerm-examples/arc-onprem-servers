#cloud-config
#
# This is an cloud-init file to install the azcmagent.
#
#
#
# Stop the walinux agent and b) configure the firewall to block the Instance Metadata Service.
#
# This allows azcmagent to be installed and the VM to be onboarded to Azure Arc
# as if it was an on prem virtual machine.
#
# Don't create files in /tmp during the early stages that cloud-init works in. Use /var/run.
# Generated runcmd script run as root: sudo cat /var/lib/cloud/instance/scripts/runcmd
# Cloud-init output: cat /var/log/cloud-init-output.log
